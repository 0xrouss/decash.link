## Access the Link Creation Page

To begin creating a link, first navigate to [decash.link/app](https://decash.link/app). You can also start the process by clicking the **Create link** button, which is conveniently located both in the center of the page and at the top right corner of the [landing page](https://decash.link).

## Log In with Your Wallet

Once you are on the [link creation page](#access-the-link-creation-page), the next step is to log in with your wallet. Click the **Log in** button situated at the top right corner of the page. This will prompt you to connect your wallet, which is essential for making any transactions or deposits.

Ensure that you connect the wallet from which you want to deposit the funds into the link. This step is crucial as it authorizes the transaction and links your wallet to the platform.

## Enter Your Email for Verification

For security purposes, you will need to provide your email address. Enter your email in the designated field to receive a verification code. This ensures that only you have access to the account and can proceed with the transaction.

## Make the Deposit

Now that your wallet is [connected](#log-in-with-your-wallet) and your email verified, you can proceed to make the deposit. Enter the amount you wish to deposit in either USD ($) or in a specific token. Remember, the funds will be taken from the wallet you just connected, so ensure it has sufficient balance.
